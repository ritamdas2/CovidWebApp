# COVID  APP
## By Ritam Das & Fatima Dantsoho


The COVID App is web application that tracks your daily symptoms while providing you with important information about COVID around the world
using a reliable and accurrate data source (https://covid19api.com/). The COVID daily tracker app requires a Single Sign On through Gmail or Facebook. The admin user must single sign on through Google.

The Administrator Dashboard provides information about how healthy all users within the database are with regard to COVID-19. It will show the names, email ID and location of the user. Most importantly, it lets the admin know which users are at risk and which are not based on their responses in the COVID questionnaire. 

The User Dashboard displays comparative figures from countries around the world and the confirmed cases which are updated daily.

The COVID questionnaire is aimed at identifying both asymptomatic and symptomatic users who are carrying COVID-19 so they can be promptly treated and limit the spread. Upon completion of the questionnaire, the "At Risk" status of the user is updated. 

Users will need to be manually added to the database through the Firebase console.

Firebase will host this web application at the following link:

With Firebase command line tools, it is possible to locally host this project.
